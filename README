For Fun 3D Renderer
-------------------
The purpose of this project is to build a programmable 3D pipeline, entirely 
written in software, using SDL and LUA. 

One of the goals is to provide clear and relatively optimized code, without 
loosing clarity. Since the result framework will be terribly slow compared to 
hardware accelerated alternatives such as OpenGL and DirectX, at least it 
should serve as a solid study base for computer graphics students.

The project is being constructed for Windows Platform using Visual Studio 2010.
The code may use C++11 code, such as lambda. Portability is NOT a goal.
